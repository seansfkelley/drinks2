drink images in list
clickable glass descriptors for a quick note on them
less ugly title for detail view
move away from JSON because it's too verbose (yml would be easy and already much better)
stylize notes text
icons for tab bar!
rewrite sources -- no need for another object, just a name and URL (even with repeats this is probably the better solution)

custom stuff
- taking a picture of the drink
- deleting of custom drinks
- more fine-tuned editing of the ingredient
