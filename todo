mode: drinks with ingredient X in them (search bar in mixable view!)
drink images in list
clickable glass descriptors for a quick note on them
section titles index for browse-all mode
less ugly directions/notes
spacing between images in drinks list?

BUGS:
invisible sections in ingredients list cause toggling the immediately succeeding ingredient to move up while animating
various spacing in detail view is totally fucked
