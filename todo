drink images in list
less ugly title for detail view
move away from JSON because it's too verbose (yml would be easy and already much better)
stylize notes text?
plaintext search for ingredients?
clickable ingredients to see what they are

code improvements
- eventing for when things like the indices change
- more efficient ways to compute groupings, search (incremental)
- separate indices for in-memory, custom, web, etc.?

make it less painful and more obvious how to add recipes
- ingredients should have a default display
- perhaps some mini-language for specifying drinks?
- YAML is so much easier to write
- validate recipe sanity on program start for testing purposes

glasses  -- what's a good way to include them as a reference
garnish  -- should these be treated separately from regular ingredients?
profile  -- save sets of ingredients so you don't have to re-enter them all the time
mood     -- what subjective properties does the drink have that you want?
gimmick  -- shake the phone to pop up a random mixable drink (name = Shaken?)
variants -- show lists of variants on drinks
similar  -- display suggestions for similar drinks

custom stuff
- editing of a drink that's already saved
- taking a picture of the drink
- more fine-tuned editing of the ingredient
- "deleting" of built-in drinks (with ability to restore from some settings page)

polish
- return button should be more useful for custom field
- swipe to navigate through recipes (alternate to buttons)
- image for drink in detail view
- should be able to search all by ingredient or drink name
- separate garnish ingredient from main ingredients
- allow list or other formatting (Markdown?) for instructions?
