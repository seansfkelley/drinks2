drink images in list
less ugly title for detail view
move away from JSON because it's too verbose (yml would be easy and already much better)
stylize notes text

code improvements
- eventing for when things like the indices change
- more efficient ways to compute groupings, etc.


glasses -- what's a good way to include them as a reference
garnish -- should these be treated separately from regular ingredients?

custom stuff
- taking a picture of the drink
- more fine-tuned editing of the ingredient
- "deleting" of built-in drinks (with ability to restore from some settings page)
