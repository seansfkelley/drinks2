drink images in list
clickable glass descriptors for a quick note on them
less ugly title for detail view
move away from JSON because it's too verbose (yml would be easy and already much better)
when switching tabs, default back to list even if it was left in detail view
generalize notes/instructions details display mechanism to make it easier to add a source section with a URL
icons for tab bar!
