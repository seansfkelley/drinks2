prev/next in recipe-results lists
mode: drinks with ingredient X in them
drink images in list
clickable glass descriptors for a quick note on them
section titles index for browse-all mode
sort ingredients smarter -- something like "Tequila (Reposado)" or sorting "Reposado Tequila" by "tequila reposado"

BUGS:
invisible sections in ingredients list cause toggling the immediately succeeding ingredient to move up while animating
