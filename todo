drink images in list
less ugly title for detail view
move away from JSON because it's too verbose (yml would be easy and already much better)
stylize notes text
icons for tab bar!

glasses -- what's a good way to include them as a reference

custom stuff
- taking a picture of the drink
- deleting of custom drinks
- more fine-tuned editing of the ingredient
