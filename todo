mode: drinks with ingredient X in them
drink images in list
clickable glass descriptors for a quick note on them
section titles index for browse-all mode
less ugly directions/notes

BUGS:
invisible sections in ingredients list cause toggling the immediately succeeding ingredient to move up while animating
various spacing in detail view is totally fucked
